[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/xfischer/DEM.Net)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xfischer/dem-net)

*Note : this is still a work in progress. Except first version at end of January 2067 (worst case).
Let me know what you need*

# DEM.Net 
Digital Elevation Model samples in C#. GeoTiff file parsing and DEM querying.
The goal is to provide on the fly DEM querying from GeoJSON or WKT geometries :
- No big RAM cache
- Fast and optimized data retrieval as precise as possible

# Coming soon...
- All incoming features are listed in the Issues here : https://github.com/xfischer/DEM.Net/issues. Feel free to suggest any idea you'd like to see covered here.
- Provide a simple sample for getting Height Maps (Unity based samples) and vizualising DEM as 3D meshes
- Provide a simple sample to drape a line onto a DEM
- If you have specific needs, let me know (create an issue)

# SampleApp 
(Work in progress)
SampleApp is a Console App used for test purposes.

- Use `new GeoTiffService().GenerateReport(DEMDataSet.AW3D30, <bounding box>)` to download only necessary tiles using remote VRT file.

- Use `GeoTiffService.GenerateDirectoryMetadata(samplePath);`to generate metadata files for your GeoTIFF tiles.
These metadata files will be used as an index when querying Digital Elevation Model data.

# Sample data
- GeoTiff from http://www.opentopography.org
Dataset used is "ALOS World 3D - 30m" : http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidar?format=sd&platform=Satellite%20Data&collector=JAXA
*For development and tests, files covering France were used.*
- Not used yet but worth mentionning :
For sea bed elevation : ETOPO1 Global Relief Model https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html
